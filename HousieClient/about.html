  <p>A typical bingo ticket is shown below. It contains 27 spaces, arranged in nine columns by three rows. <br />
	  Each row contains five numbers and four blank spaces. Each column contains up to three numbers, which are arranged as follows, <br />
    The first column contains numbers from 1 to 9,<br />
    The second column numbers from 10 to 19,
	  The third, 20  to 29 and so on up until the last column, which contains numbers from 80 to 90.	  </p>
  <p>Tickets are created as strips of 6, because this allows every number from 1 to 90 to appear across all 6 tickets. If they buy a full strip of six it means that players are guaranteed to mark off a number every time a number is called </p>

      <strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
    <p>The game is presided over by numbers as they are randomly selected,  by an electronic random number generator (RNG) and displayed on the screen.<br />
    As the numbers are displayed on the screen with an interval of 10 secs,the players have to mark the displayed number on their ticket,if the number exisits in their ticket. <br />
  The different winning combinations are:</p>
    <p>Early Five - The first player who ha marked five numbers in their single ticket is the winner of 'Early Five' <br />
    First 
    Line – covering a horizontal line first line of five numbers on the ticket.<br />
    Second 
      Line – covering a horizontal line second line of five numbers on the ticket.<br />
      Third 
      Line – covering a horizontal line Third line of five numbers on the ticket.<br />
    Full House – covering all fifteen numbers on the ticket.</p>
    <p>The winner should yell out by clicking on the Line or House button depending on the prize , if he/she  has won any of the above winning combinations.<br />
      In all cases, the last number called must be in the winning sequence. If a player does not stop the game in time and the caller calls out the next number the player's winning claim is often invalidated.<br /></p>
